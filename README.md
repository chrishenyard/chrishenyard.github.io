# 👋 Hi, I'm **Christopher Henyard**
### **Senior Full-Stack .NET Engineer | Architect | Problem Solver**

I build high-performance systems, high-scale data pipelines, and secure multi-tenant platforms using modern .NET technologies.

My focus: **clean architecture, measurable performance, reliability, and long-term maintainability** — especially in contract environments where ownership, delivery speed, and autonomy matter.

---

## 🚀 **My Current Goals**

- Build **enterprise-grade .NET platforms** that emphasize simplicity and long-term reliability  
- Deepen expertise in **low-level Linux, networking, and virtualization** (pfSense/OPNsense, Proxmox)  
- Continue modernizing ecosystems from **legacy .NET → ASP.NET Core**  
- Master **fully automated deployment ecosystems** using Docker & CI/CD  
- Expand into **developer tooling** for Stripe, gRPC, and Wallet integrations  
- Contribute more **open-source utilities** around performance, data ingestion, and multi-tenant architectures  

---

## 🧰 **Tech Stack & Tools I Use Daily**

### **Backend & Architecture**
- **ASP.NET Core 7–9**, C#, EF Core 8/9  
- REST APIs, **gRPC**, Webhooks  
- Multi-Tenant Systems, Middleware, Interceptors  
- Channels, Background Services (Hosted Services)

### **Payments & Integrations**
- **Stripe** (PaymentIntents, Subscriptions, 3DS, SetupIntents, Off-Session Billing, Application Fees)  
- **Apple Wallet (PassKit)**  
- **Google Wallet Objects API**  
- OAuth 2.0, HMAC auth patterns

### **Data Engineering**
- SQL Server 2012–2022  
- Performance tuning, indexing, MERGE optimization  
- Large-scale ingestion (7GB–15GB+ CSV pipelines)  
- ETL pipelines, BCP automation, streaming architectures

### **Cloud, DevOps & Infrastructure**
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Linux server administration  
- Proxmox virtualization  
- Secure environment configuration & containerized ecosystems

### **Frontend (Minimal but Effective)**
- JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
- jQuery DataTables (dynamic modals + AJAX CRUD)  
- Lightweight and maintainable UI patterns

## 🏆 **Highlighted Achievements**

### **✔ Built multi-tenant architectures**
Designed tenant-aware routing, scoped DbContexts, and middleware-based tenant resolution — enabling clean separation of customer data and behavior.
